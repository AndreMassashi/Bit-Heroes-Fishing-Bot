## Introduction

This program allows you to automatically fish for a set amount of bait. Just pick the amount of bait you want to use and press start and let the bot fish for you. This program is not 100%, however, it will always be better than a human. I do not guarantee a 100% catch rate, but I do guarantee a very high catch rate for very little effort.

Pull requests are ***welcomed*** and ***encouraged***!

## How to use
### First steps
- To make sure this program runs correctly, a few setting settings need to be checked.
	- Windows zoom settings need to be set to 100% and you need to be at default resolution as such in Display Settings for Windows 10:

	- If you are using **Steam**: Please make sure the game is set to 800x600 as such:

	- If you are using **Kongregate**: Please make sure the browser you are using is on 100% page zoom. For example, chrome:

### Getting started with the program
- Download the .exe from the [releases](https://github.com/tiemonl/Bit-Heroes-Fishing-Bot/releases) tab in GitHub.
- Run the file
- you will see this screen:

### Setting up the program
- Select Kongregate or Steam depending on which platform you are fishing in
    - If you are using steam, make sure to set the window size to 800x600
- Then select the rod you are using to fish
- Enter the amount of bait you want to go through
- Calibrate the program to know where to fish by pressing the **Find Start Location** button on this screen:

### Fishing
- Once you've calibrated the program, you should have a coordinate to the right of the button resembling this: {X=100, Y=300}
    - If you have multiple monitors, make sure Bit Heroes is in the primary monitor. If Bit Heroes is in the second monitor, the program will not work and your coordinates will be {X=0, Y=0}. This indicates it did not calibrate correctly.
- Press Auto mode and let the program fish for you.
    - If you need to cancel Auto Mode for whatever reason, press cancel and the program will finish catching the current fish, before stopping.


## Upcoming feature(s)
- Stop fishing after you catch a certain weight of fish to save bait for another event. i.e. Stop fishing if you catch a fish above 12 kg. (currently not working on this project, I may go back to finishing this in the summer when I have more time)
