### Setting up the program
- Select Kongregate, Kartridge, or Steam depending on which platform you are fishing in
    - If you are using steam, make sure to set the window size to 800x600
- Then select the rod you are using to fish
- Enter the amount of bait you want to go through
- Calibrate the program to know where to fish by pressing the **Find Start Location** button on this screen:

### Fishing
- Once you've calibrated the program, you should have a coordinate to the right of the button resembling this: {X=100, Y=300}
    - If you have multiple monitors, make sure Bit Heroes is in the primary monitor. If Bit Heroes is in the second monitor, the program will not work and your coordinates will be {X=0, Y=0}. This indicates it did not calibrate correctly.
- Press Auto mode and let the program fish for you.
    - If you need to cancel Auto Mode for whatever reason, press cancel and the program will finish catching the current fish, before stopping.
