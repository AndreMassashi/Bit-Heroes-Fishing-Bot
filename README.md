## Introduction

This program allows you to automatically fish for a set amount of bait. Just pick the amount of bait you want to use and press start and let the bot fish for you. This program is not 100%, however, it will always be better than a human. I do not guarantee a 100% catch rate, but I do guarantee a very high catch rate for very little effort.

Pull requests are ***welcomed*** and ***encouraged***!

## How to use
### Windows
The windows program features a GUI and more setup available. It is compatible with both Steam and Kongregate. For more information please view the [README in the csharp section.](./csharp)

### Mac/Linux
This version relies on Java. Please make sure you have java downloaded on your machine. It is a CLI only tool currently. Download [bh-fisher.jar](https://github.com/tiemonl/Bit-Heroes-Fishing-Bot/releases) from the releases tab. For more information please view the [README in the java section.](./java)

This version is still in beta. If you come across any issues, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/tiemonl/Bit-Heroes-Fishing-Bot/issues) and be as detailed as possible. I will add another README in the java directory with more details on how to run the program.
